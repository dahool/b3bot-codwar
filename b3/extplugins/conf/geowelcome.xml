        You can limit the connection by using cf_allow_from,
        cf_deny_from, and cf_order. Please specify this by the country
        code of two characters. Basically, it is the same as the
        mod_access module of Apache. See this URL:
    
        http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_access.html
    
        Examples:
        
        Allowing only NL and US. Others are denied:
        <set name="cf_order">deny,allow</set>
        <set name="cf_deny_from">all</set>
        <set name="cf_allow_from">NL US</set>
        
        Denying only US. Others are allowed:
